# hello-world
Hello Github!

Basically just following the tutorial, maybe I'll make this a repository of lots of different hello world programs just for fun. All these examples will be written for UNIX/Linux. Executable files will not be included. Anything that
must be compiled must be done by yourself.

Added C hello world program.
Added python3 and python2 hello world programs.
