'GITTING' GOOD WITH GIT

				SETTING UP THE REPOSITORY
1)Make a directory somewhere on your file system specifically for the git project.

2)cd into the new directory and un the command 'git init'. This sets the directory up to work
  with git

3)run the commands 'git config --global user.name "your name"' and 'git config
  --global user.email "your email address"'. This info is used to track file changes.

4)You can run 'git config --list' to display information about the repository

      	      	   	  	 CONFIGURE A REMOTE REPOSITORY
1)run 'git remote add origin https://github.com/*.git'

2)Next run 'git remote -v'.

				UPLOAD YOUR WORK
1)Execute 'git add "filename"' to add the file to the project

2)Run 'git commit -m "comments about the commit"'

3)Run 'git push origin master' to upload your changes to the master branch.
